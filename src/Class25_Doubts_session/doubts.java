	//this- Keyword (use cases)
	//1.In the constructor , "this" keyword is used to initialize class variables with local variables 
	//2.in case of getters and setters - encapsulation
	//3.builder pattern -return this 
	//4.in constructor calling as well 
	
	
	//Constructor-
	//5.if we create a business logic in constructor - unnecessary it will be executed as we create the object
	//6. We can call one constructor from another constructor using "this()" keyword
	//   but it should be very first statement in the constructor
	
	
	// Void and return cannot be together 
	// But if we are returning nothing then it can be together 
	// eg-as below
	// so if we want to launch a browser or print something in that case Void and return cannot be together

	// Same package we cannot have duplicate class
	
	//Super Keyword
